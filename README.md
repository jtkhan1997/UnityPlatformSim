# UnityPlatformSim
This project was created to simulate Kinetic art, and ultimately could be used as an application on hardware to simulate a platform. It essentially uses a prefab tile and grid manager program to dynamically create and manipulate platforms and when the simulation runs each unit moves along the y-axis in a random range, as well as a random color. I added functionality to manually move units and save their positions during runtime.

I also created input keys for testing features including buttons to start/stop, increase/decrease range of displacement on y-axis, quit, generate random colors from red, blue, green or greyscale spectrums, as well as randomized RGB colors.

The game has several scenes, the first being a main menu which takes you to several scenes: the platform setup scene where you configure your platform, platform programming scene where you can program individual nodes/units to be simulated later, and a Platform Simulation scene where you load a platform program file, create a platform based on the data and simulate it.
